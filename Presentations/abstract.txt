Fuzzy Gibbs measures, in a sense a natural generalization of hidden Markov models, serve as a powerful tool for studying the (absence of) pathologies of the renormalization group. We first present the formalism, developed in Steven Berghout's dissertation, which equips us with a powerful sufficient condition for Gibbsianity of the fuzzy Gibbs measure, the absence of hidden phase transitions. We then proceed to apply this condition to two known examples, obtaining alternative proofs of their Gibbsianity. The first is the fuzzy Potts model on \mathbb{Z}^d, for which we provide a conceptually much simpler alternative to Häggström's original proof, exploiting the relationship between Potts model and random-cluster representations. The second example is a special case of infinite-temperature spin-flip dynamics (started from a Gibbs measure), studied by van Enter, Fernández, den Hollander and Redig, for which we first argue that it can be interpreted as a fuzzy Gibbs model, and than proceed to give alternative proofs for some result, which carry a striking resemblance to the original proofs.
